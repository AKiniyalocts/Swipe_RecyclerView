<a href="https://github.com/47deg/android-swipelistview-sample">47deg/android-swipelistview-sample</a>  ( sample of the above library )

I have modified the sample and also the library to work with a RecyclerView instead of a ListView.<br>
Just Playing around with RecyclerView.<br><br>

<b>RecyclerView</b><br>
The RecyclerView widget is a more advanced and flexible version of ListView. This widget is a container for displaying large data sets that can be scrolled very efficiently by maintaining a limited number of views. Use the RecyclerView widget when you have data collections whose elements change at runtime based on user action or network events.<br>
It was introduced in Android Lollypop (5.0) and you can read more about it <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html">here.</a>
